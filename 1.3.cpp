/*1.3	The mass of a sphere is given by the expression M = 4/3(p*pi*r**3 ) where M, p and r are, respectively, the mass of the sphere, the specific mass of the material from which it is made, and its radius. Write a program that, given the values of ÔÅ≤ and r, determines the value of M. The user must be informed about the units used to represent all the values: Kg/m3 , m and Kg for p, r and M, respectively. Use a constant to represent the value of pi.*/
